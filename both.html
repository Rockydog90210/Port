          Coco and Blue have been friends for a little less than a year now. They haven't known each other for long but they were instant bffs when they met. Coco and Blue met one spring day, Blue had just been brought to his brand new home, and Coco was there with the warmest of welcomes. They got along so perfectly. After Blue got settled into his new home they just talked about everything, they played games and watched movies and showed each other their hobbies. it's honestly so sweet. Blue told Coco about his life before he came here, and to this day Coco if the only one who knows.

          To this day Blue and Coco teach each other their hobbies, you find the two of them sitting in the tree together singing and painting and talking about every thought that comes to their mind. Sometimes you find them both sitting in cups and bowls reading their books just being in company with each other, enjoying each other. coco has taught Blue to paint and draw and do all kinds of arts and crafts. and Blue has shown coco how to play in trees without falling, how to read, they both mean so much to each other
