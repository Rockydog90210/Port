          There's another spectacular feeling we just have to talk about! and it's blue! the north ether cardinal who needs no further introduction. What's there to say? he's red while Blue doesnt get up to as much as Coco does, he is still absolutely incredible. He spends most of his time inside cosying up with his friends, or reading his favorite book while drinking hot chocolate. Blue also loves to spend time outside, sitting in the tree, jumping from branch to branch letting out a loud 'chirp chirp chirp!' His vibrant red feathers help him stick out from all the other birds. Blue also loves helping in the garden, mostly because he loves eating the food he grows, strawberries are his favorite

          It's unknown where blue was born and raised, he was shipped to Oregon last year in a case of avian trafficking. He was soon rescued and brought to a loving family where he now resides. Little is known about his life before he was brought here. understandable blue doesn't like to bring up his past. sometimes we'll reference it but never in grave detail. Sometimes things are better left unspoken. All that matters now is that he's safe with his new family. Blue doesnt like to travel nearly as much as coco, he barly travels at all, but hes just as happy and content as coco is.
