          Through his many adventures Coco has learned so many things. He's a very special seal. He paints and draws and can set up a whole campsite. He can dig awesome holes in the sand which is impressive due to the fact he doesn't have arms. He loves learning many things, and even when they don't go as he planned, he still comes out with knowledge that will help him learn for next time. Coco really is the jack of all trades, though he may not be the master of one, it's better than not having any hobbies. Right now, Coco spends his time learning psychology and biology and even how to code! he loves pushing the limits of what he tries to code, in fact coco helped in the coding of this website! What a versatile little seal. we should all aspire to be more like coco.
